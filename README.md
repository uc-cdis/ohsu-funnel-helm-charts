> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> This Helm Chart repo has traditionally been used for deploying CALYPR-related services by external collaborators (e.g. Gen3-Workflow + Funnel) 
>
> The larger CALYPR "Umbrella" Helm Chart may be found at [calypr/gen3-helm](https://github.com/calypr/gen3-helm)
>
> ~Moving forward, this repo will likely be merged into [calypr/gen3-helm](https://github.com/calypr/gen3-helm) at which point collaborators can be notified of the change.~
>
> Upon review, "merging" this repo into Gen3-Helm will likley break current setups/workflows while offering negligble benefits. Keeping this repo as-is!
